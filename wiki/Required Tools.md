1. [Blender](https://blender.org)

2. [Crowbar](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool)

3. [Blender SourceTools](https://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/)

4. Text Editor. I prefer [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), but you may use any other text editor that supports syntax highlighting. Other contestants are sublime and Notepad++. The advantage of VSCodium is that it can open the entire LUA folder in an overview for quick jumps between files. It's kind of more like an IDE. There are also GLua addons available for it that add syntax highlighting for Gmod Lua.

5. Image editing tool such as GIMP, and a tool for converting to VTF. There's a VTF Plugin for GIMP, by the way.


Blender and the Texture editing software are only required if you're planning on modelling your train as well.
